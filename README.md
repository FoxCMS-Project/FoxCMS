Martijn van der Kleijn, the main developer of the "Wolf CMS" fork, has discontinued the project for
the time being. And to keep the mind of "Content Management Simplified" as well as the Frog CMS
and the Wolf CMS (of course) alive, I decided to takeover the future development. In this sense 
the Fox CMS is the unofficial Sequel of the Wolf CMS and the era of simplified Content Management! 

**But beware:** Version 0.8.4 (Alpha), which is currently still in development, is the first version 
of this fork, which just will come along with some Basic Enhancements, Security Fixes and Updates as 
well as some "forward-looking lines". I try to renew the complete CMS and adapt it to current 
standards, step-by-step.

Check out the [develop branch](https://github.com/SamBrishes/FoxCMS/tree/develop) or the respective
[changelog file](https://github.com/SamBrishes/FoxCMS/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) to see the current 
status of the first Fox CMS Version 0.8.4 (Alpha)!
